Furthermore, the article details the specific impacts on phonological skills, morphological and syntactic development, vocabulary, pragmatic skills, and semantic understanding. Concluding recommendations emphasize the importance of content quality, co-viewing, establishing screen-free zones, parental pre-screening, adherence to the 20-20-20 rule, and adult modeling of responsible screen behavior.",

          "Over time, the nervous system adapts to that high-speed input — meaning calm, quiet play feels boring by comparison.",
          "According to <em>Tech Generation</em> (Uhls & Lasser, 2019), constant digital stimulation disrupts the brain’s ability to self-regulate, increasing tantrums, impulsivity, and attention difficulties. Some children even show ADHD-like symptoms — not because they have ADHD, but because their sensory system has been trained for instant reward and fast feedback."
