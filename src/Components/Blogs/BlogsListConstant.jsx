One of the biggest challenges is that many of these disorders overlap in their symptoms and can often co-occur, making diagnosis and intervention tricky. In this blog, we’ll break down the different types of developmental conditions — both neurodivergent and neurotypical — and highlight the key features that set them apart. This can help parents identify early signs and seek timely support from professionals.",
