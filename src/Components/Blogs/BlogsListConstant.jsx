            "This article provides a comprehensive overview of screen time, encompassing its definition and recommended usage durations as advised by the WHO and AAP. It elaborates on the mechanisms through which excessive screen time contributes to speech and language delays, specifically highlighting reduced parent-child interaction, displacement of critical real-life experiences, the prevalence of one-way communication, and the potential for overstimulation. Furthermore, the article details the specific impacts on phonological skills, morphological and syntactic development, vocabulary, pragmatic skills, and semantic understanding. Concluding recommendations emphasize the importance of content quality, co-viewing, establishing screen-free zones, parental pre-screening, adherence to the 20-20-20 rule, and adult modeling of responsible screen behavior.",
